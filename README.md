Basic Calculator in Java
This is a simple Basic Calculator project written in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the selected operation.

Features
Addition: Add two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtract two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
Division: Divide two numbers (with error handling for division by zero).
Input validation: Handles invalid inputs and exceptions.
How to Use
The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
The user then selects an operator (+, -, *, or /) for the desired operation.
The program performs the operation and displays the result.
If invalid input is entered (e.g., non-numeric values or divide by zero), the program handles the error and provides feedback to the user.
Example of Program Interaction
mathematica
Copy code
Welcome to the Basic Calculator!
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 5
The result of 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Error Handling Example
vbnet
Copy code
Welcome to the Basic Calculator!
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter the second number: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero.
Project Structure
The project consists of a single file:

BasicCalculator.java: Contains the logic for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and handles user input and exceptions.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
Basic understanding of running Java programs from the command line.
Steps to Run:

Clone or download this repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder where BasicCalculator.java is saved.
Compile the program:
Copy code
javac BasicCalculator.java
Run the program:
Copy code
java BasicCalculator
How It Works
The program asks for the first number.
Then, it prompts the user to choose an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, or /).
It asks for the second number and then performs the operation.
The result is displayed, or an error message is shown in case of invalid input (e.g., dividing by zero or entering non-numeric data).
Code Breakdown
Methods:
add(double a, double b): Returns the sum of a and b.
subtract(double a, double b): Returns the difference between a and b.
multiply(double a, double b): Returns the product of a and b.
divide(double a, double b): Returns the division of a by b. Throws an ArithmeticException if b is 0.
Exception Handling:
The program handles ArithmeticException for division by zero and general Exception for invalid input (non-numeric values).
Possible Enhancements
Add support for more complex expressions (e.g., 10 + 5 * 3).
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
Add functionality for more advanced mathematical operations like square root, power, and trigonometric functions.
Implement a feature to display a history of calculations.
